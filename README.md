In this collaborative Python project, our team worked together to enhance and analyze a dataset, focusing on tasks such as data cleaning, visualization, and classification. Each team member was assigned specific responsibilities, covering diverse areas like data cleaning, variable renaming, visualization, and normalization. Our structured approach aimed to contribute collectively to a comprehensive dataset analysis.
By utilizing GitHub branches, we maintained independent workspaces, ensuring version control and efficient collaboration. This repository outlines each collaborator's tasks, functions developed, and insights gained.
